Description: Geneplast is designed for evolutionary and plasticity analysis based on orthologous groups distribution in a given species tree. It uses Shannon information theory and orthologs abundance to estimate the Evolutionary Plasticity Index. Additionally, it implements the Bridge algorithm to determine the evolutionary root of a given gene based on its orthologs distribution.
